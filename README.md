# PARTIAL IMPRESSIONS
In 2020, leaving the wrong impression can get you in trouble. Getting someone else's impression, on the other hand, can get you out of a pickle. 

In a world where the gates between one state to another are ruled by technology, will you be able to make a good enough of an impression to move around freely? 

Remember - impressions come in many different shapes and sizes. Dental impressions. Shoe impressions. Fingerprint impressions. Only you can find the one that works for you.
